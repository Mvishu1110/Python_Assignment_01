## Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
 Ans: Python is a general-purpose and high level programming language  because  it can be 
      used to create variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems,
      All sorts of technological solutions have Python at their core, from web applications,
      search engines, and games to animation software and even other programming languages.

    
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
 Ans: We don't have to declare the type of a variable or manage the memory while assigning a value to a variable in python,
      it itslef take care of the memmory management which is very crucial in programming hence python is dynamically typed 
      language.
      

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
  Ans:       Pros                          Cons
       Beginner-friendly	    Issues with design
       Large Community	          Slower than compiled languages
       Flexible and Extensible    Security
       Extensive Libraries	    Work Environment
       Embeddable	                High memory consumption
       Highly Scalable	          Dynamically-typed language
       IoT Opportunities	    Complex multithreading
       Portable	                Garbage collection leads to potential memory losses



Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
 Ans: Python is the go-to programming language for domains such as artificial intelligence, 
      machine learning and deep learning, it’s no surprise that it’s also a fundamental 
      tool for any data scientist.



Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
 Ans: Variable is a container for storing data values, in python we dont have any specific command to 
      Create variable, the variable is created the moment you assign the value to it.
      e.g  A= 10, where 'A' is the variable and '10' is the value assigned to it.



Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
 Ans: input (): This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string.
      Python provides a built-in function called input which takes the input from the user. 
      When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the user’s input. 
      When the user presses enter, the program resumes and returns what the user typed.  
      eg . inp = input('STATEMENT')
      val = input("Enter your value: ")
      print(val)


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
 Ans : String is theh default data type.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to 
     the operation required to be performed by users.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods. 
     Using split() method and Using List comprehension

     1) Using split() method : 
         This function helps in getting multiple inputs from users. It breaks the given input by the specified separator. 
         If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator. Generally, users use a split() method to split
         a Python string but one can use it in taking multiple inputs.
         # taking two inputs at a time
         x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
         print("Number of boys: ", x)
         print("Number of girls: ", y)
         print()
     2) Using List comprehension : 
         List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create list in Python. We can create lists just like mathematical 
         statements in one line only. It is also used in getting multiple inputs from a user.
         # taking two input at a time
         x, y = [int(x) for x in input("Enter two values: ").split()]
         print("First Number is: ", x)
         print("Second Number is: ", y)
         print() 

Q10. What are keywords?
 Ans: Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can’t be used for 
      anything other but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available—you’ll never have to import them 
      into your code.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans : We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. 
      They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
 Ans : Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
       Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, 
       the indentation in Python is very important beacuse Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
 Ans: We can Throw output in Python using Print() function.


Q14. What are operators in Python?
 Ans: In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. 
      The values that an operator acts on are called operands.
      e.g A > 10 , Where A is the variable , '>' is the operator and '10' is the Operand.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
 Ans: /--> operator is used to get division Quotients  as Float  and 
     //--> Operator is used to get division Quotients as Integer.


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")



Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even. 
 Ans : num = int (input ("Enter any number to test whether it is odd or even:"))
            if ((num%2)> 0 ):

              		print ("The number is odd ")

		else:

             		print ("The provided number is even")





Q18. What are boolean operator?
 Ans :Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as
      conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and
      productive results.





Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0                      ----> Ans 1

0 and 0                     ----> Ans 0

True and False and True     ----> Ans True

1 or 0 or 0                 ----> Ans 1


```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
 Ans: A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. 
      These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.
      Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know:
      if statement
      if-else statement
      if-elif-else ladder


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
 Ans: if Statement:
      The if statement is a conditional statement in python, that is used to determine whether
      a block of code will be executed or not.Meaning if the program finds the condition defined 
      in the if statement to be true, it will go ahead and execute the code block inside the if statement.
      Syntax:
	if condition:
       	 # execute code if condition is true
      
      if-else Statement:
      The if statement executes the code block when the condition is true. Similarly, 
      the else statement works in conjuncture with the if statement to execute a code block 
      when the defined if condition is false.
      Syntax:
	if condition:
       	 # execute code if condition is true
	else:
        	 # execute code if condition if False
      
      The elif statement is used to check for multiple conditions and execute the code block 
      within if any of the conditions evaluate to be true.
	if condition1:
    		# execute this statement
		elif condition2:
   		# execute this statement
		.
		.
		else:
    		# if non of the above conditions
    		# evaluate to True
    		# execute this statement
      

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
 Ans: Age = int(input("Please enter your age "))
	if(Age >= 18):
       	 print("I can vote")
	else:
        	print("I cant vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
	even_sum= 0
	for num in numbers:
    		if(num%2==0):
       	 even_sum=even_sum + num
	print(even_sum)  



Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
 Ans:		x, y,z= [int(x) for x in input("Enter Three values: ").split()] 
		if(x>y>z):
       		 print(x,"is the greatest ")
		elif(y>z>x):
       		 print(y,"is the greatest")
		else:
    			print(z,"is the greatest")



Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
     for i in numbers:
        if(i % 5==0):
        
           if(i >500):
              break
           elif(i >150): 
            continue
           print(i)
